MINI PROJECT 1: ZOMBIE APLOCALYPSE
In this mini-project,I created a simulation of zombies and humans interacting on a grid. As in the movies, our zombies are hungry for human brains. As a result, zombies chase humans and humans flee from zombies.
The positions of the zombies and humans will be restricted to a grid. In this simulation, zombies are not very agile and can only move up, down, left or right in one step of the simulation. On the other hand, humans are more agile and can move in these four directions as well as the four neighboring diagonal directions. If a zombie catches a human by positioning itself in the same cell, zommbie will eat humans .
